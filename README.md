# Harkirat Rust Marathon

Minimal notes for practicing Rust basics and small exercises.

## Quick Start

- Install the Rust toolchain via `rustup` (includes `cargo` and `rustc`).
- Run the current project: `cargo run`
- Format code: `cargo fmt`
- Run tests: `cargo test`

## Project Tips

- Keep each concept in its own module or example to stay organized.
- Prefer `cargo check` for fast feedback while iterating.
- Add short comments near non-obvious code paths to capture learnings.
